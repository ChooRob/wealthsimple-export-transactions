User script that adds buttons to export transaction activity from the WealthSimple website.

Based on this published user script : https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/500403-wealthsimple-export-transactions-as-csv

Current updates to the script from the base script :
- Added more supported transaction types. More transaction types are most probably missing and will be added as I encounter them.
