User script that adds buttons to export transaction activity from the WealthSimple website.

To use this script, you will need to have a user script extension (such as [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)) installed.

Based on this published user script : https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/500403-wealthsimple-export-transactions-as-csv

Current updates to the script from the base script :
- Added more supported transaction types. More transaction types are most probably missing and will be added as I encounter them.
